# Characters that are Replaced or not Shown

Users provide the content for the README.yaml files and the data ends up on a 
web page. So for the security of the web page users there is a set of 
characters that will be replaced. Read the code for the details.

# YAML Parsing Errors

Any errors in the YAML parsing are not sent to the website. We just show on the
website the path to the README.yaml which had the parsing error.
Read the code for the details.
