# About This Site

The content of these web pages comes from researchers maintaining small
`README.yaml` files containing information about their data directories.
This information is collated by the "Data Directory Cataloger" program 
each evening.
See the [Data Directory Cataloger](https://github.com/speleolinux/data_directory_cataloger).
That collation of information is then turned into these web pages by the static
web site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org).
